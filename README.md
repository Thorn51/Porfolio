## Full-stack Developer

I am a full-stack developer, lifelong student, and creative
problem solver. To me, coding is a magical place where creativity and logic converge to give life to ideas and dreams.

When I'm not deep into a project I want to be outside in the sun. I love to explore the Rocky Mountains, cycle, and get my dog outside for long walks.

## Toolbox

- React
- Node
- Express
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Incubator

The purpose of the Code Incubator application is to create a place to submit full-stack web development project ideas, receive feedback, and to help inspire future students. After an idea is submitted users can vote and comment on the idea.

### National Park Explorer

This application takes advantage of the National Park Service API. Users will be able to search states to discover all of the amazing activities the National Park Service has to offer. The application will allow users to create a profile, rate parks, save favorites, and comment on their experience at the various locations. This set of features is just a starting place, the MVP, of an application that could grow into a social hub on the amazing resources available to the public through the National Park Service.
