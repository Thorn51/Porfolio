## Full-stack Developer

I am a full-stack developer, lifelong student, and creative
problem solver. To me, coding is a magical place where creativity and logic converge to give life to ideas and dreams.
  
When I'm not deep into a project I want to be outside in the sun. I love to explore the Rocky Mountains, cycle, and get my dog outside for long walks.
